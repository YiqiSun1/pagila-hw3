 * Management wants to rank customers by how much money they have spent in order to send coupons to the top 10%.

 * Include a "percentile" column that contains the customer's percentile spending,

 * Order the results alphabetically.

 * HINT:
 * I used the `ntile` window function to compute the percentile.
